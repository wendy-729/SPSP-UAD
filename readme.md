Datasets from Hongbo Li, Hanyu Zhu, Linwen Zheng, and Fang Xie, (2022, working paper), Software project scheduling under activity duration uncertainty.<br>
Datasets SET_RG:<br>
Network structure data generated using Rangen for instances with different OS values.
- OS_0.3: 20 instances with 7, 12 and 22 activities, respectively. The OS of these instances is 0.3.
- OS_0.5: 20 instances with 7, 12 and 22 activities, respectively. The OS of these instances is 0.5.
- OS_0.7: 20 instances with 7, 12 and 22 activities, respectively. The OS of these instances is 0.7.

File format description.emf: The file format of Rangen's output is illustrated. It should be noted that we only use the data of the  network structure of project, direct successors  of activity and the duration of the activity.

data_set_rg.xlsx: Contains detailed parameters for each instance.

Datasets SET_CLS:<br>
SET_CLS is generated by extending the dataset of Correia et al. (2012)
- Network structure：60 instances with 22 activities

data_set_cls.xlsx: Contains detailed parameters for each instance.
